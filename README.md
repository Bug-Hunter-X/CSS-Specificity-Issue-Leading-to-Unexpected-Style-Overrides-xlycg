# CSS Specificity Bug
This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue related to specificity.  A more specific selector unintentionally overrides a less specific one, resulting in unexpected styling. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version.

## Problem
The original CSS code suffers from specificity issues, leading to some styles being unexpectedly overridden.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing and adjusting the CSS selectors to ensure the intended styles are applied, considering the rules of CSS specificity.
